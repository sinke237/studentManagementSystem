### Explanation of Code

@SpringBootTest: indicates the test should be run as a spring boot test; it tells spring boot to auto create an application context for the test, this context holds all the beans(dependencies) needed for the applicaiton to run e.g StudentService bean, StudentRepository bean.

@Mock: used to create a mock object of the StudentRepository. It allows to simulate the behaviour of the repository without actually interacting with the database.

`Mockito.when(studentRepository.save(student)).thenReturn(student)` : sets up the mock behaviour of the `save` method the StudentRepository. Whenever this method is called, it returns a student object.

``saving_and_retrieving_student_should_work_correctly``: this is the test method. It tests the scenario for saving and retrieving students.

`given().a_student_service()`: this method calls a superclass's `given` method to set up the initial statet of the test. I have override written this method to ensure it does returns non-null instance(which is not working yet).

`Student student = new Student(...)`: creates a new student object with some data.

`when().a_student_is_saved(student)`: calls the `when` method of the test class to indicate that a student is being saved.

Next, we have assertions in the `then()` block. They verify that a student was saved successfully and can be retrieved.

Lastly, I am overring the `given()` method to avoid null pointer exception in the test. But no luck.
